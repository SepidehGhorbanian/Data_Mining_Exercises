# Several Data Mining Projects


## Project Intro
Each folder contains a certain project relating machine learning. In these projects the main purpose is to prepare the data and analyze it, use different methods of machine learning and visualization.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Visualization
* Data Analysis
* Supervised learning 
* Unsupervised learning
* Test Mining
* Dimensionality Reduction

## Getting Started
