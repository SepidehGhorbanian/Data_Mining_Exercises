# Text Mining


## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to analize the 'Little Women' book written by Louisa May Alcott and graph the narrative arc of the story.

### Methods Used
* Text Preprocessing
* Text tokenization
* Sentiment Analysis
* Visualization

### Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Afinn](https://pypi.org/project/afinn/)

## Project Description
 Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights. One of the common ways of sentiment analysis in a text is Sentiment Scoring which is a scaling system that reflects the emotional depth of emotions in a piece of text.
 The AFINN lexicon is a list of English terms rated for valence with an integer between -5 (negative) and +5 (positive).
 
 The change in sentiments throughout the story is shown by plotting the sentiment arc for the text sections:

## Getting Started

1. Download and install python on your computer
2. Make sure to install libraries that have been mentioned before in the 'Technologies' section of the text, if you don't already have them
3. You can either directly download this repo or clone it (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)) 
4. Text is the Little women book that is stored [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Data_Mining_Exercises/blob/main/Little_Women/Little_Women.txt)
5. Data processing is being kept [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Data_Mining_Exercises/blob/main/Little_Women/Little_women.py)
6. Run the code in python and see the results
