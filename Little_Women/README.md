## Project Description
 Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights. One of the common ways of sentiment analysis in a text is Sentiment Scoring which is a scaling system that reflects the emotional depth of emotions in a piece of text.
 The AFINN lexicon is a list of English terms rated for valence with an integer between -5 (negative) and +5 (positive).
 
 The change in sentiments throughout the story is shown by plotting the sentiment arc for the text sections:
