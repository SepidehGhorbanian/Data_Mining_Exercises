Time Series Decomposition Algorithm

Dataset: Air passengers dataset
The data contains the number of passengers each month throughout different years from 1949 untill 1960
First thing to do is understanding and analyzing the data
By plotting the data we can see that there is a pattern for the number of passsengers over time: The number is increasing over time but we have a dramatic seasonal shift

We want to be able to predict patterns
