# Predicting Breast Cancer


## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not, using KNN algorithm from the classification algorithms.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling
* Performance Evaluation

### Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.6+
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project Description
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer.
K_nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is one of the simplest forms of classification. KNN classifies the new data points based on the similarity measure of the earlier stored data points.


## Getting Started

1. Download and install python on your computer
2. Make sure to install libraries that have been mentioned before in the 'Technologies' section of the text, if you don't already have them
3. You can either directly download this repo or clone it (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)) 
4. Dataset is from the UCI website [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/)
5. Data processing and transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Data_Mining_Exercises/blob/main/KNN_BreastCancer/BreastCancer_KNN.py)
6. Run the code in python and see the results
