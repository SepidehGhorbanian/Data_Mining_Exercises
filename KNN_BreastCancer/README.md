# Predicting Breast Cancer


## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not, using KNN algorithm from the classification algorithms.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling
* Performance Evaluation

### Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.6+
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project Description
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer.
K_nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is one of the simplest forms of classification. KNN classifies the new data points based on the similarity measure of the earlier stored data points.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Dataset is from the UCI website [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/)
3. Data processing and transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Data_Mining_Exercises/blob/main/KNN_BreastCancer/BreastCancer_KNN.py)
