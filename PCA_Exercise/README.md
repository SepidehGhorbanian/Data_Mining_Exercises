Dimensionality reduction is an important part of machine learning

Principal Component Analysis algorithm is one of the most common algorithms that can transform the data into a low dimensional space

Dataset: The 'swiss' dataset which has Standardized fertility measure and socio-economic indicators for each of 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland at about 1888.

We combine the features using PCA algorithm from the sklearn library.

We can see that we can reduce the features to 2 components and still have a clear seperation on the data.
