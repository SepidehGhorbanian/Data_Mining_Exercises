# Clustering Penguins Dataset


## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to cluster the Penguins dataset using the Hierarchical algorithm from the clustering algorithms.

### Methods Used
* Data Preparation
* Machine Learning
* Visualization

### Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)

## Project Description
Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. Agglomerative clustering is a bottom_up approach which means each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.

Dendrogram is being used to determine the best number of clusters. That is shown [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Data_Mining_Exercises/blob/main/Hierarchical_Penguins/Dendrogram%20of%20Penguins.png) 

Finally, the scatter plot of the result of hierarchical algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Data_Mining_Exercises/blob/main/Hierarchical_Penguins/Clusters%20of%20Penguins_Hierarchical.png)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/))
2. Dataset is the PalmerPenguins that can be easily installed on your computer using the pip install command
3. Data transformation script is being kept [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Data_Mining_Exercises/blob/main/Hierarchical_Penguins/Hierarchical_Penguins.py)
